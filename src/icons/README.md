The open-needs-icon.svg is the source of the icons in the public folder.
All favicons were generated using https://favicon.io/favicon-converter.

The logo is an optimized version of the
[open-needs pen](https://github.com/open-needs/open-needs.github.io/blob/main/images/open-needs-icon.svg)
for small icon sizes.
